Features
Interactive Inputs:

Input stock tickers dynamically (e.g., AAPL, MSFT).
Select date ranges to fetch historical stock data.
Visualizations:

Closing Price Over Time: Interactive line chart showcasing trends.
Moving Averages (10-day and 50-day): Visualized for short-term and long-term trend analysis.
Predictive Modeling:

Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict stock movement:
