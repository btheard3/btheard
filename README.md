 Predicting Stock Movement
This Streamlit app predicts whether a stock's closing price will increase or decrease the next day based on historical data. It includes robust data visualizations and a machine-learning pipeline.

Features
Interactive Inputs:

Input stock tickers dynamically (e.g., AAPL, MSFT).
Select date ranges to fetch historical stock data.
Visualizations:

Closing Price Over Time: Interactive line chart showcasing trends.
Moving Averages (10-day and 50-day): Visualized for short-term and long-term trend analysis.
Predictive Modeling:

Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict stock movement:
1: Stock price increases.
0: Stock price decreases.
Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-scores.
